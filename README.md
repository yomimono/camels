# how do I play?

Use the arrow keys (or vi-keys, if you prefer) to choose an action from the list of highlighted things.  Do that action by pressing space or enter.  Keep doing that until you've won or decide to go do something else.

# how do I win?

Excellent question.  Next!

# how do I install?

It's [camels](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/camels/) on opam. [Install opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) and then you can install with:

```
opam install camels
```

# i don't like emoji :(

Consult `camels --help` for alternative invocation modes.

# it's slow :(

You're running it on a potato.  You can disable expensive floating-point eye candy; consult `camels --help` to see how.

# this game makes a camels.sav in my current directory???

Sure does.  You can tell it to save somewhere else with `camels -f`.
